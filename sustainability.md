title: "Sustainability for course: Data Science in Biomedical Research"
---

There are several major aspects of this project and course that ensure its
sustainability into the future:

- This course will be openly licensed (CC-BY 4.0) and publicly accessible. All
material can be freely copied, modified, and reused by anyone, including future
instructors of this course.
- Due to the format of the course (e.g. "participatory live-coding"), the learning
material is fairly well structured, organized, and developed. This ensures that
anyone taking over the course will have a fairly easy time instructing it.
- Several of the interested instructors are collaborating on projects aimed at
developing openly licensed teaching material that overlaps with this courses
aims (Data Science for scientists). Therefore this course will continue to be
actively developed and maintained in the foreseeable future, regardless of
graduation or employment. See the projects organization's [GitHub] and [GitLab]
repositories.

It has been our experience with the [EEB RQM course] that once we developed the
material, it alone was more than enough for new instructors to use and teach
without much preparation. In the second year of the [EEB RQM course], two of
the four instructors were new and had little difficulty teaching the material.
